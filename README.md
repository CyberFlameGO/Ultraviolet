# UltraViolet
[Infrared](https://github.com/haveachin/infrared) but different. 

## What is different?
Well... 
- This doesnt work (yet?)
- This might have breaking changes any commit
- 

## What this is
Maybe its a personal test project for future infrared features or maybe it will be a separate project closely related to Infrared 

## Features
[] (Maybe) Working minecraft proxy
[] Being able to reload without closing existing connections
[] 

## Some notes
### Tableflip (not implemented yet)
This has implemented [tableflip](https://github.com/cloudflare/tableflip) which should make it able to reload/restart UltraViolet without closing existing connections on Linux and macOS. UltraViolet should still be usable on windows (testing purposes only pls). 
Check their [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cloudflare/tableflip) to know what or how.

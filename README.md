# UltraViolet
## What is it
[Infrared](https://github.com/haveachin/infrared) but different. Not even sure or this will be a real production ready product some day, its a different structure I want to try.  


## Some notes
### Tableflip
This has implemented [tableflip](https://github.com/cloudflare/tableflip) which should make it able to reload/restart UltraViolet without closing existing connections on Linux and macOS. UltraViolet should still be usable on windows (testing purposes only pls). 
Check their [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cloudflare/tableflip) to know what or how.
